QUARK - Molecular Graph Representation with 3D Geometry

This repository provides the source code for QUARK, a model designed for molecular generation using graph-based representations with integrated 3D geometric information. The model has been fine-tuned using GraphMVP architecture, on smaller "bace" dataset, that contains inhibitors of human beta-secretase 1.
